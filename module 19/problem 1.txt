Give the sequences of nodes examined when the methods in BST are used to compute each of the following quantities 
for the tree drawn at below.
a. floor("Q") 
b. select(5) 
c. ceiling("Q") 
d. rank("J") 
e. size("D", "T") 
f. keys("D", "T")
ans:
a. floor("Q")
	Q is comapared with the root node E and moves to right and again coampares, then Q=Q and returns q as output.
b. select(5) 
	5 is compared with the rank of the root node i.e 3 and moves to right, when moved to right all the left nodes 
including root are deleted form the 5, i.e, 5-1-2, that gives us 2. 2 is compared with updated rank of Q which is 2 
and returns the output as Q.
c. ceiling("Q") 
	Q is comapared with the root node E and moves to right and again coampares, then Q=Q and returns q as output.
d. rank("J") 
	J>E
TRUE
moves to right and compares
J>Q
FALSE 
moves to left and compares
J==J
gives 3
e. size("D", "T") 
returns the number of keys in given range
E , J , M , Q , S
f. keys("D", "T")
D,E,J,M,Q,S,T
